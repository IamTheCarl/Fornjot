## Status

Fornjot is usable for some toy examples, but currently lacks the features for something more advanced. Work to change that is underway.


## Overview

This is a list of the crates that make up Fornjot, along with a short description for each, starting with the most basic ones and leading up to the high-level ones:

- [`fj`]: All-in-one API that re-exports all of the following crates.
- [`fj-math`]: Math primitives used by the rest of Fornjot.
- [`fj-interop`]: Basic types that allow other crates to interoperate, without depending on each other.
- [`fj-core`]: Core primitives and code operating on those primitives.
- [`fj-export`]: Exports Fornjot models to external data formats.
- [`fj-viewer`]: Displays Fornjot models.
- [`fj-window`]: Simple windowing abstraction for use with `fj-viewer`.

## Usage

Fornjot is a set of Rust libraries (see list above). The definitive documentation on how to use those is their reference documentation. The `crates.io` pages of each library (see list above) link to those.

If you want to use Fornjot to create a specific model in Rust, the best starting point are the [example models](models/) in this repository:

- To display a model, run `cargo run -p cuboid` (replace `cuboid` with name of model you want to display).
- To export a model, run `cargo run -p cuboid -- --export model.3mf` (replace `cuboid` with name of model you want to export; optionally replace `3mf` with another supported file format).
- To see full set of CLI options, run `cargo run -p cuboid -- --help` (all models have the same CLI interface, so this shouldn't differ much between them).
