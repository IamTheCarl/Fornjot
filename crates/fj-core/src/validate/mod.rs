//! # Infrastructure for validating objects
//!
//! ## Structure
//!
//! Every single requirement is checked by a dedicated function. These functions
//! are called **validation checks**. Validation checks are currently not
//! visible in the public API, but their structure is reflected in the variants
//! of the different enums that make up [`ValidationError`] (each validation
//! check produces one of the types of validation error, that these nested enums
//! represent).
//!
//! In principle, the absence of validation errors should guarantee, that an
//! object can be exported to an external file format without problems (which
//! falls under the purview of the [`fj-export`] crate). This has not yet been
//! achieved, as some validation checks are still missing.
//!
//! The [issue tracker] has open issues for some of those missing checks, but
//! others are not currently tracked (or not even known). Please feel free to
//! open a new issue (or comment on an existing one), if you encounter an object
//! that you believe should be invalid, but is not.
//!
//!
//! ## Use
//!
//! All objects implement the [`Validate`] trait, which users can use to
//! validate objects manually. This might be useful for debugging, but is
//! otherwise not recommended.
//!
//! Experience has shown, that stopping the construction of a shape on the first
//! validation failure can make it hard to understand what actually went wrong.
//! For that reason, objects are validated as they are constructed, but
//! validation errors are collected in the background, to be processed when the
//! whole shape has been finished.
//!
//! This is set up within the [`Layers`] API, and validation errors result in a
//! panic, when the [`Layers`] instance is dropped. Unless you want to handle
//! validation errors in a different way, you don't have to do anything special
//! to use the validation infrastructure.
//!
//!
//! ## Configuration
//!
//! Fornjot's geometry representation is set up to prioritize correctness, which
//! is achieved by making the relations between different objects *explicit*.
//! This means, for example, that coincident objects of the same type that don't
//! have the same *identity* are generally considered invalid.
//!
//! Coincidence checks must use a tolerance value to be useful, meaning objects
//! that are very close together can be considered coincident. What should be
//! considered "very close" is dependent on the scale that your model operates
//! on, and this fact is taken into account by allowing for configuration via
//! [`Validate::validate_with_config`] and [`ValidationConfig`].
//!
//!
//! ## Implementation Note
//!
//! This module is in the process of being replaced. See [`crate::validation`].
